                    <p>A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring
                        which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot,
                        which was created for the bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed
                        in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents. I should be
                        incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was a
                        greater artist than now.</p>
                    <p>When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper
                        surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner
                        sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close
                        to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little
                        world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms of the insects
                        and flies, then I feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image, and the
                        breath.</p>
